# Gemini AI-Powered Data Harvesting Feature

## üöÄ Overview

The Data Harvest feature has been enhanced to use Google's Gemini AI to intelligently generate learning resources based on your actual academic data stored in Supabase. This creates a personalized educational content library tailored to your institution's curriculum.

## üß† How It Works

### **1. Academic Context Extraction**
The system analyzes your existing data to understand your academic landscape:

- **Classes**: Extracts all classes with their subjects, professors, and course information
- **Grade Entries**: Analyzes grade entries to identify learning outcomes and assessment patterns
- **Subjects**: Identifies unique subjects and their academic levels
- **Learning Outcomes**: Examines proficiency levels and educational goals

### **2. Gemini AI Processing**
Using your Gemini API key, the system:

- **Analyzes Academic Data**: Processes classes, grade entries, and subjects
- **Generates Relevant Resources**: Creates 100-150 diverse learning resources
- **Ensures Quality**: Validates and structures the generated content
- **Maintains Diversity**: Covers multiple resource types and academic domains

### **3. Intelligent Resource Generation**
Gemini AI creates resources across:

- **Videos**: Educational videos, tutorials, lectures
- **Books**: Textbooks, reference materials, academic texts
- **Articles**: Research papers, academic articles, documentation
- **Courses**: Online courses, MOOCs, structured learning paths
- **Documents**: PDFs, guides, study materials

## üìä Generated Resource Features

### **Smart Categorization**
Resources are automatically tagged with:
- **Academic Topics**: Based on your subjects and learning outcomes
- **Difficulty Levels**: Matched to your students' academic levels
- **Resource Types**: Balanced across all learning formats
- **Engagement Metrics**: Realistic likes/dislikes ratios

### **Source Diversity**
Resources come from various reputable sources:
- YouTube (educational channels)
- Coursera (professional courses)
- edX (university courses)
- Khan Academy (free educational content)
- Google Books (academic texts)
- Wikipedia (reference materials)
- MIT OpenCourseWare (university resources)
- TED (educational talks)

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **API Endpoint**
```
POST /api/admin/learning-resources/harvest
```

### **Process Flow**
1. **Data Extraction**: Queries Supabase for academic context
2. **AI Processing**: Sends context to Gemini AI for analysis
3. **Resource Generation**: AI generates structured learning resources
4. **Validation**: Validates and formats the generated data
5. **Database Insertion**: Stores resources in Supabase
6. **Response**: Returns summary of generated resources

### **Performance Limits**
- **Resource Limit**: 100-150 resources per harvest
- **Grade Entry Limit**: 1000 entries analyzed per run
- **Processing Time**: Typically 10-30 seconds
- **API Efficiency**: Optimized for minimal API calls

## üìà Academic Context Analysis

### **Classes Analysis**
```sql
SELECT classes.class_name, subjects.subject_name, professors.first_name
FROM classes 
JOIN subjects ON classes.subject_id = subjects.subject_id
JOIN professors ON classes.professor_id = professors.prof_id
```

### **Grade Entries Analysis**
```sql
SELECT grade_entries.score, grade_components.component_name, 
       learning_outcomes.outcome_description
FROM grade_entries
JOIN grade_components ON grade_entries.component_id = grade_components.component_id
JOIN learning_outcomes ON grade_entries.outcome_id = learning_outcomes.outcome_id
```

### **Subject Extraction**
- Identifies unique subjects across all classes
- Extracts subject codes, names, and academic levels
- Analyzes course associations and prerequisites

## üéØ Gemini AI Prompt Engineering

### **Comprehensive Context**
The AI receives detailed information about:
- Class structures and academic levels
- Assessment patterns and learning outcomes
- Subject diversity and academic focus areas
- Grade entry patterns and proficiency levels

### **Intelligent Generation**
Gemini AI is prompted to:
- Create resources relevant to identified subjects
- Balance resource types across academic domains
- Generate realistic URLs and engagement metrics
- Ensure academic quality and relevance

## üìã Generated Resource Structure

```json
{
  "title": "Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms",
  "description": "Comprehensive course covering complex data structures and algorithmic patterns for computer science students.",
  "type": "course",
  "source": "Coursera",
  "url": "https://coursera.org/learn/data-structures-algorithms",
  "author": "Stanford University",
  "topics": ["Data Structures", "Algorithms", "Computer Science"],
  "tags": ["advanced", "programming", "computer-science"],
  "likes": 3240,
  "dislikes": 45,
  "is_active": true
}
```
