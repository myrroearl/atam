- **Type Filtering**: Filter by resource type (video, book, article, course, document, other)
- **Source Filtering**: Filter by source (YouTube, Google Books, Wikipedia, etc.)
- **Status Filtering**: Filter by active/inactive status
- **Data Harvest Button**: Prominent button for triggering data harvesting (UI ready, functionality placeholder)
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, modern layout that works on all screen sizes

### 2. CRUD Operations

- Safe deletion process

### 3. Navigation Integration
- Added "Learning Resources" to admin sidebar navigation
- Proper routing to `/admin/learning-resources`

- Complete type definitions for LearningResource interface
- Request/response types for API integration
- Filter types for advanced search functionality
- Constants for resource types and sources

## Database Schema Support
The interface is designed to work with the existing `learning_resources` table:
```sql
create table if not exists public.learning_resources (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  title text not null,
  description text,
  type varchar(50) not null,
  source varchar(100) not null,
  url text not null,
  author text,
  topics text[],
  tags text[],
  likes int default 0,
  dislikes int default 0,
  is_active boolean default true
);
```

## UI/UX Features
- **Modern Design**: Clean, professional interface matching existing admin theme
- **Responsive Layout**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, loading states, and smooth transitions
- **Accessibility**: Proper labeling, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
- **Data Visualization**: Engagement metrics display with like/dislike counts
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no resources are found

## Data Harvest Feature
- Prominent "Data Harvest" button in the header
- Loading state with spinner animation
- Placeholder functionality ready for backend integration
- 3-second simulation of harvesting process

## Mock Data
The interface includes realistic mock data for demonstration:
- Various resource types (videos, books, courses)
- Different sources (YouTube, Coursera, Google Books)
- Sample topics and tags
- Engagement metrics (likes/dislikes)
- Realistic titles and descriptions

## Future Enhancements Ready
- API endpoint integration points clearly defined
- Error handling structure in place
- Loading states implemented
- Form validation ready
- Search and filter functionality complete
